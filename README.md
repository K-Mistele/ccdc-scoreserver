# Blacklight's CCDC Score Server
A scoreserver for teams to use while training for CCDC. Runs on port `8080`.
Note that security was (ironically) _not_ a core design features, since I had to build this in a week. 
My assumption is that I will never run this on an untrusted network or on the public internet, since
it is designed for use in a virtual lab. Call it an accepted risk.

**Therefore**
* you should probably not run this on an untrusted network
* you should probably not run this on the public internet
* you should probably inform your red team this server is out of scope :)

Enjoy!

## Running with Go
Note: requires a newish version of go that supports go modules. I used 1.15. 
This also requires having mongo installed locally, 0/10 don't recommend. Use `docker-compose` (below)
Also - in `lib/database/database.go`, change the connection string so it's localhost instead of the container name. 

Wouldn't really recommend doing this since it can be a pain - just run it from `docker-compose`. Seriously.

```bash
go get
go run server.go
```

## Running with Docker-Compose
Do not run with only docker - there is no Dockerfile for Mongo, since that's dealt with in the `docker-compose.yml` file.


```bash
docker-compose up
```
